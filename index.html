        <H2>THE AIM</H2>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p>
            Have you ever wondered what happens to the information you put online? Who sees it, or even where it goes once it’s online? Guise is a concept that caters to the curious who ask themselves these question. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Guise aims to promote web transparency and empower the users. Unlike other applications or browser plug-ins that simply alert the user to trackers and block them from tracking, Guise gives the user the power to not only see who is tracking them (an option available elsewhere) but also see what information the trackers are taking and what they are doing with this information. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A key part of this concept is creating an easy way for the consumer to acknowledge the darker side of the web, and web services common society take for granted. The side that takes the information uploaded and uses it for analytic purposes and other services. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This application highlights the willingness of consumers to publish information about themselves online without a second thought and the potential consequences or benefits of this. 
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p>
            Guise is an unbiased service that displays information clearly for the consumer, so they can view how their online behaviours can effect their online experience (e.g. targeted ads) and how this effects their privacy. 
          </p>


          <h3>PRECEDENTS</h3>

          <p>
            The precedents that helped to influence the development of this concept include two popular anti-tracking browser plug-ins currently available for free, Ghostery and Do Not Track Plus. However, these two precedents focus on blocking trackers (one slightly more hands-on than the other in approach but both being competitors for the same market). 
          </p>

          <p>
            These two precedents achieve one part of the Guise aim successfully, but are still limited when it comes to allowing the consumer to see what information is being tracked, and for what purpose. This is where Guise aims to take one step further and help to educate and inform the consumer in a non-invasive manor.

          <h2>THE APPLICATION</h2>
          <p>The mobile application will send pop-up notifications to the user while they browse, alerting to the trackers present. The user can then load the application to view more details, such as how many trackers currently are monitoring. From there the user can select each tracker individually to view specific information about who the tracker is, how they link to the current site, what information they are tracking and why. This is all presented to the user in clean list format with collapsable tabs.</p>

          <h2>THE FUNCTION</h2>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
              <p> Guise works by monitoring the web servers called from the current web page the user is browsing, and matches it against a list of trackers. This imformation is then displayed in an easy to read and understandable manor so the user can view which trackers are monitoring their actions. This is linked to the cookies and tags websites place on the device as the user browses, and aims to highlight this to the user.</p>

              <P>The code languages needed to achieve this include basic html and css along side bootstrap. Also, the implementation of PHP code, and jQuery/JavaScript will be required.</P>
            </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <p> 
              The code required to make this application is very complex, as is the service the application aims to offer. Extensive trialing and research is required to get the desired effect, especially as this design concept ventures into a more specific field of the web that is not often acknowledged. This means references are limited and examples of functioning code are hard to discover (making it more labour intensive).

          <h2>  RESEARCH </h2>

          <p>
          Research into using new code languages I haven't used before (such as JavaScript) was important for the development and functionality of what this project aims to achieve. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Another aspect of developing this idea that was very important, was researching how cookies and multiple forms of tracking occurs. For this, the below is an example of how cookies can recognise the device and remember them. This example measures how often this site is visited by the same device. While this is different to that which this project aims to monitor, it was important to understand how cookies function.
          </p>
          <p> 
<SCRIPT>
function GetCookie (name) { 
var arg = name + "="; 
var alen = arg.length; 
var clen = document.cookie.length; 
var i = 0; 
while (i < clen) {
var j = i + alen; 
if (document.cookie.substring(i, j) == arg) 
return getCookieVal (j); 
i = document.cookie.indexOf(" ", i) + 1; 
if (i == 0) break; 
} 
return null;
}
function SetCookie (name, value) { 
var argv = SetCookie.arguments; 
var argc = SetCookie.arguments.length; 
var expires = (argc > 2) ? argv[2] : null; 
var path = (argc > 3) ? argv[3] : null; 
var domain = (argc > 4) ? argv[4] : null; 
var secure = (argc > 5) ? argv[5] : false; 
document.cookie = name + "=" + escape (value) + 
((expires == null) ? "" : ("; expires=" + expires.toGMTString())) + 
((path == null) ? "" : ("; path=" + path)) + 
((domain == null) ? "" : ("; domain=" + domain)) + 
((secure == true) ? "; secure" : "");
}
function DeleteCookie (name) { 
var exp = new Date(); 
exp.setTime (exp.getTime() - 1); 
var cval = GetCookie (name); 
document.cookie = name + "=" + cval + "; expires=" + exp.toGMTString();
}
var expDays = 30;
var exp = new Date(); 
exp.setTime(exp.getTime() + (expDays*24*60*60*1000));
function amt(){
var count = GetCookie('count')
if(count == null) {
SetCookie('count','1')
return 1
}
else {
var newcount = parseInt(count) + 1;
DeleteCookie('count')
SetCookie('count',newcount,exp)
return count
}
}
function getCookieVal(offset) {
var endstr = document.cookie.indexOf (";", offset);
if (endstr == -1)
endstr = document.cookie.length;
return unescape(document.cookie.substring(offset, endstr));
}
</SCRIPT>
<SCRIPT>
document.write("You've visited this site <b>" + amt() + "</b> times.")
</SCRIPT>
    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to understand the functionality of cookies and how third party trackers tag computers via the visited sites is fundamental to the functionality of this concept.
